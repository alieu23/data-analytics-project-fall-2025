# Final Project

Students will work to develop a **data analytics pipeline** for a selected real-life application.

## Final Report Requirements

The final report should include the following sections:

1. **Description of the Problem**  
   Provide a clear explanation of the real-world problem being addressed.

2. **Data Acquisition and Processing Methods**  
   Describe how the data was collected, cleaned, and preprocessed.

3. **Chosen Analytical / Machine Learning Models**  
   Specify which analytical or machine learning models were selected and why.

4. **Post-Processing and Visualization**  
   Explain how the results were refined and visualized for interpretation.

5. **Evaluation and Conclusions**  
   Summarize the model performance, insights gained, and overall conclusions.

## Phase One
 **Project Description and Proposal** --- Done

## Phase Two
   In this phase, you will collect your dataset and make it ready for analysis. You must perform essential preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, fixing formatting issues, handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, and applying scaling when needed. Submit both the raw and cleaned datasets along with a brief report describing the preprocessing steps you applied and the challenges you encountered.
